            It is a butter cake kissed by cocoa and turned red! Iâ€™m joking. It is butter cake, mixed with unsweetened cocoa powder and red food coloring is added to give it a great vibrant color.

A long time ago, beetroot juice was used to make this cake, but that required a longer time. You have to juice the beetroot, then the juice had to be boiled and reduced to half, and then it is added to the cake batter.</td></tr>
